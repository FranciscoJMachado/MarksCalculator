# MarksCalculator

This is a free Application, currently developed on Java platform, and is made to help students to calculate their marks. 
It's also my first time that I'm using GIT by myself, outside of university classes. 


## Code Example

Currently I'm working on the design and funcionalities of this App. Once I start to develop the code, I will change this paragraph.

For version 1.X, the funtionalities are:
-- The App is suppose to contemplain multiple Scenerios for example different grade schales (1 to 100, 0 to 20, 1 to 200, 1 to 10, ...)
-- Different number of evaluation moments (for example we can have 4 tests, or 2 tests during a semester/year/... )
-- Different weights on different evaluation moments (for example to 4 evaluation moments we can have 10% for the first evaluation moment, 30% for second, 32% for third and 36% for fourth evaluation moment).

For evaluation 2.X, the funtionalities are:
-- Add a mechanism to calculate how much a student have to get on the remain evaluation moments to get a mark that he wants.


## Motivation

I've noticed that around the world, students of all ages have troubles to calculate their marks. They have to deal with the % of evaluation components and how many they have. On the first version (1.xx), it's only a "simple" very frindly calculator. It's suposse that this calculator is used for many scenerios, like different marks schales, different number of evaluations with different weights.


## Installation

Well, on classes we just use an App called SmartGit, where we clone and download the code. 


## API Reference

I don't think I get that far, for now.


## Tests

No tests Available yet. You can always run the app and test it by yourself
